# Project Instructions for Claude Code

## Auto-Commit Policy

**After every code change, always commit and push the changes unless explicitly told not to.**

This includes:
- New files
- File modifications
- File deletions
- Any other code-related changes

When committing:
1. Stage all relevant changes
2. Write a clear, concise commit message describing the change
3. Push to the current branch

Skip committing only when the user explicitly says "don't commit", "no commit", "skip commit", or similar.

# Screenshot Capture

ScreenCapture provides three distinct capture modes to handle any screenshot scenario.

## Capture Modes

| Mode | Shortcut (Safe) | Shortcut (Native) | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| [Area](/docs/capture/area) | `Ctrl+Shift+4` | `Cmd+Shift+4` | Interactive region selection |
| [Window](/docs/capture/window) | `Ctrl+Shift+5` | `Cmd+Shift+5` | Capture a specific window |
| [Fullscreen](/docs/capture/fullscreen) | `Ctrl+Shift+3` | `Cmd+Shift+3` | Entire primary display |

## Output Format

All screenshots are saved as **PNG** format by default for lossless quality.

## Post-Capture Actions

After capturing, the [Quick Access Overlay](/docs/features/quick-access) appears with options to:
- Copy to clipboard
- Save to custom location
- Open in annotation editor
- Pin as floating window
- Extract text (OCR)

## Canceling Pre-Capture

When in interactive pre-capture mode (area crosshair or window camera), press `Esc` to exit immediately.

# Storage & File Management

Manage where and how your captures are stored.

## Features

### Security-Scoped Bookmarks

Custom save locations use macOS security-scoped bookmarks to maintain access permissions across app restarts.

### Bookmark Staleness Detection

The app detects when bookmarks become invalid (e.g., folder moved or deleted) and prompts you to reconfigure.

### Storage Usage Tracking

View current storage usage in Settings > Storage.

### Auto-Save

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Interval | Every 30 seconds |
| Location | Configured save location |
